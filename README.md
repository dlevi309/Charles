An unfinished tweak that sets `CFNETWORK_DIAGNOSTICS=3` as an environment variable when launching apps, which makes network usage much more verbose when logging.

it works now on all apps, but was supposed to include a preference bundle that allows you to choose which apps are enabled (hence being "unfinished") + a force touch option similar to Choicy when launching.
